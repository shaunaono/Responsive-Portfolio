		<p>My name is Shauna Ono. I live in Elk Grove with my husband and two boys; Alex, 25 and Jared 18 years old.<br><br>

		I have been a stay at home mom for the past 17 years. During that time I have volunteered in my sons classrooms and for their sports clubs.  I have also done a lot of volunteer work in my community through being a member of the Elk Grove Lions Club.  My first year as a member, I was awarded 'Lion of the Year'. <br><br>

		I became interested in coding during my eldest sons Freshmen year of football at Elk Grove High School.  I was asked to  help re-design the teams website.  I had no previous experience with HTML or css, but was able to do simple things to make the website more parent and player friendly.<br><br>

		Since that time I have used website builders, ie; Weebly, to build websites for friends and families businesses.  I have also recently used Goodbarber app builder to build an app for a relatives business. I also enjoy social media marketing and managed a friends social media for their dessert food truck business.
